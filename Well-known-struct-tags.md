title: Well-known struct tags
---

## Background

Go offers [struct tags](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Tag) which are discoverable via reflection. These enjoy a wide range of use in the standard library in the JSON/XML and other encoding packages.

The community welcomed them and has built ORMs, further encodings, flag parsers and much more around them since, especially for these tasks, single-sourcing is beneficial for data structures.

## Problem description
Due to increased usage of Go and thus Go [struct tags](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Tag), clashes become inevitable.

## Solution
The list below is a best effort to document well-known struct tags used by packages which are available to the public.

## Format of the list
* Struct tag as extracted by calling https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#StructTag.Get with this tag as the `key` argument.
* Documentation link of this package using https://pkg.go.dev

### Example entry
Tag | Documentation
----|-----
xml | https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/xml

### Change Management
List entries can be added by anyone who creates a public package where a new tag is used.
List entries can be removed when the links to the package documentation stops working or the author(s) of that package requests it.
